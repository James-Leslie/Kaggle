# Titanic Challenge
I decided to have a go at the beginner's machine learning challenge on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The aim of the challenge is to train a model to accurately predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The full challenge description and relevant data sets can be found [here](http://https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Getting Started
Training and testing data are found in train.csv and test.csv. Code for the different approaches to the challenge are found in subfolders
